# Tahlil A. Warsame, MSc · CPHQ · CHDA · SSBB  
**Cardiovascular Clinical Informatics & Quality Analytics (MEA-focused)**

I design and implement end-to-end cardiovascular imaging workflows—orders, DICOM MWL/MPPS, PACS/VNA, and reporting—grounded in 22 years across echo and non-invasive labs. My work connects **quality frameworks** (CPHQ, CHDA, SSBB) with **data pipelines** (SQL, Power BI/Tableau, R) to deliver measurable improvements in report turnaround, data completeness, and registry readiness (NCDR).  
**Now building Epic Cupid expertise** through open repositories that simulate Cupid-adjacent workflows, registry extracts, and quality dashboards using de-identified data.  

**Focus areas**: Echo workflow optimization · NCDR/quality reporting · capacity & access analytics · MEA implementations

---

## Epic Cupid: Where I Add Immediate Value
- Translate real-world echo and cardiology workflows into Cupid build and operational decisions  
- Align registry, accreditation, and quality metrics (e.g., NCDR) with source data, documentation, and reporting  
- Bridge clinicians and IT by validating data lineage from order to final report and dashboard

---

## Highlights & Example Outcomes (from the included projects)
- End-to-end synthetic **TTE order → image → report** pipeline demonstrating MWL/MPPS conformance and traceability  
- Reproducible **quality dashboards** for turnaround time (TAT), EF reporting %, and documentation completeness  
- **Registry extract kit** with a clear data dictionary and SQL transforms to NCDR-style structures  
- **Waiting list analytics** notebooks with control charts, seasonality checks, and capacity modeling

> All datasets in this profile are synthetic or de-identified and intended for educational, portfolio, and demonstration purposes only.
