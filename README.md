**Cardiovascular Clinical Informatics & Quality Analytics (MEA-focused)**

I design and implement end-to-end cardiovascular imaging workflows—orders, DICOM MWL/MPPS, PACS/VNA, and reporting—grounded in 22 years across echo and non-invasive labs. My work connects **quality frameworks** (CPHQ, CHDA, SSBB) with **data pipelines** (SQL, Power BI/Tableau, R) to deliver measurable improvements in report turnaround, data completeness, and registry readiness (NCDR).  
**Now building Epic Cupid expertise** through open repositories that simulate Cupid-adjacent workflows, registry extracts, and quality dashboards using de-identified data.  

**Focus areas**: cardiovascular workflow optimization · NCDR Quality Reporting & Registry Integration · capacity & access analytics · MEA Regional Implementations

## 🎓 Certification Strategy

### Current Certifications
- **CPHQ** (Certified Professional in Healthcare Quality)
- **CHDA** (Certified Health Data Analyst)
- **SSBB** (Six Sigma Black Belt)
- **MSc** in Healthcare Management

### Target Certifications

| Certification | Strategic Value | Timeline |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Epic Cupid Proficiency** | **TOP PRIORITY** - Required for Epic roles | When access available |
| **CPHIMS** | Fills IT/implementation gap, highest prestige in Epic circles | 12-18 months |
| **Additional Epic Modules** | Beaker (lab integration), Radiant (imaging workflow) | Post-Cupid cert |

### Why CPHIMS Next?
With CPHQ + CHDA already achieved, CPHIMS would create a **"triple threat"** covering:
1. **Quality** (CPHQ) - Clinical excellence and regulatory compliance
2. **Analytics** (CHDA) - Data-driven insights and reporting
3. **IT Systems** (CPHIMS) - Implementation and optimization

This combination positions me for senior Epic Cupid consultant roles ($115K-$150K range) and distinguishes me in the competitive MEA market.
